# Simple Graph

This package allows the users to create simple, generic simple undirected graphs. The API allows the users to add vertices, and edges
between them either one at a time, or iteratively over a Collection type. It also allows the user to create depth-first and
breadth-first search iterators based on a starting vertex. This can be passed to a [FilterIterator](https://github.com/webrantley/Filter-Iterator)
to filter these iterators, if the user desires that behavior.
